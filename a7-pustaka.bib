   abstract = {Pregnancy is a biological process in which sperm and eggs meet each other to fertilize, and the fetus is formed in the uterus. But it's difficult; pregnant mothers sometimes have problems or discomfort during pregnancy. In addition, in areas far from the city, there are many obstacles to consulting an obstetrician. Therefore, it will be dangerous if mothers experience problems and find it difficult to get first aid. This research aims to create an expert system for pregnant women where it is not difficult for a mother to go to the doctor to ask about her complaints. The solution offered in this study is easy to access to the SP BUMIL website and automatically enters all mothers' complaints into the system. This system also provides a diagnosis and advice to pregnant women as to the best steps and an explanation of what the pregnant woman is suffering from. This expert system uses the forward chaining method, which has the advantage of producing a solution to a problem; in other words, being able to consider a problem and draw conclusions according to the facts. On this website, there is a disease information menu and also the results of the diagnosis},

   abstract = {Knowledge graphs can support many biomedical applications. These graphs represent biomedical concepts and relationships in the form of nodes and edges. In this review, we discuss how these graphs are constructed and applied with a particular focus on how machine learning approaches are changing these processes. Biomedical knowledge graphs have often been constructed by integrating databases that were populated by experts via manual curation, but we are now seeing a more robust use of automated systems. A number of techniques are used to represent knowledge graphs, but often machine learning methods are used to construct a low-dimensional representation that can support many different applications. This representation is designed to preserve a knowledge graph’s local and/or global structure. Additional machine learning methods can be applied to this representation to make predictions within genomic, pharmaceutical, and clinical domains. We frame our discussion first around knowledge graph construction and then around unifying representational learning techniques and unifying applications. Advances in machine learning for biomedicine are creating new opportunities across many domains, and we note potential avenues for future work with knowledge graphs that appear particularly promising.},

   abstract = {Knowledge engineering involves simulating the problem solving logic of a human expert, group of experts, or a constructed “expert process.” It is the integration of assimilated information as knowledge with data. This is, in fact, the procedure used in human decision making. The potential capabilities for knowledge engineering to help solve ill-structured agricultural problems where information and data are incomplete has excited many scientists. However, knowledge engineering is in its infancy and is not ready for widespread, economically viable application to commercial agriculture. The state of the art for developing and using agricultural knowledge-based decision support “expert” systems is discussed; representative examples depicting areas that are most promising are presented, and specific examples from the authors' experiences are given. These are followed by comments on commercialization, pitfalls, needed developments, and prognosis.},

This paper summarizes an approach to synthesizing decision trees that has been used in a variety of systems, and it describes one such system, ID3, in detail. Results from recent studies show ways in which the methodology can be modified to deal with information that is noisy and/or incomplete. A reported shortcoming of the basic algorithm is discussed and two means of overcoming it are compared. The paper concludes with illustrations of current research directions.},

   abstract = {The development of high-throughput, data-intensive biomedical research assays and technologies has created a need for researchers to develop strategies for analyzing, integrating, and interpreting the massive amounts of data they generate. Although a wide variety of statistical methods have been designed to accommodate ‘big data,’ experiences with the use of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques suggest that they might be particularly appropriate. In addition, theÂ results of the application ofÂ these assaysÂ reveal a greatÂ heterogeneity in the pathophysiologicÂ factors and processes that contribute to disease,Â suggesting that there is a need to tailor, or ‘personalize,’ medicines to the nuanced and often unique features possessed by individual patients. Given how important data-intensive assays are to revealing appropriate intervention targets and strategies for treating an individual with a disease, AI can play an important role in the development of personalized medicines. We describe many areas where AI can play suchÂ a role and argue that AI’s ability to advance personalized medicine will depend critically on notÂ onlyÂ the refinement of relevant assays, but also onÂ ways of storing, aggregating, accessing, and ultimately integrating, the data they produce. We also point out the limitations of many AI techniques in developing personalized medicinesÂ as well as consider areas for further research.},
